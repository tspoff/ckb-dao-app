# DAO Proposals
Proposals are on-chain requests to the voters of a DAO. When a majority of voting weight in a DAO signs off on a proposal & its' outcome, the proposal can pass on-chain.

## DAO Modification
Proposes changes to the DAOCore data, such as changing parameters or adding voters.

## General
Proposes a list of fully-specified output cells w/ CKB amounts. Very generic to facilitate many types of on-chain action the DAO would want to perform. 

`Note: It will likely need to specify requirements for input AND output cells in the future to become more generic`

The proposal can be consumed if all it's required outputs are present in the transaction.
