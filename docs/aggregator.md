# Aggregators
Aggregators will be external services that monitor the blockchain & decentralized file storage, monitoring the required pieces for DAO proposal transactions and packaging them into complete transactions to be submitted when ready to pass on-chain.

They are incentived by configurable **tips** from the given DAO, which allows them to take a small fee to compensate them for their service.

`Note: Fees don't scale with transaction costs (Which will vary based on the number of signatures as well as the nature of the type scripts for proposal outputs)`

`Question: The aggregator only needs to include >50% of signatures to pass a transaction, so what happens if they opt not to include some valid signatures to reduuce costs? This means there is no layer 1 record of this vote occuring which might have implications down the line.`

All data is stored in a decentralized manner by the dApp, so anyone is welcome to operate an aggregator.
